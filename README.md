*When your prompts are messier than your love life, Comma Drama makes them look like a cinematic masterpiece.*

## Overview
Comma Drama is a work-in-progress web app for cleaning up and reordering Stable Diffusion (SD/SDXL) prompts.  
It takes messy text and reshapes it into structured prompts that are easier to read, edit, and use.
